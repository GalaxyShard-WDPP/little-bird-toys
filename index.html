                Our handcrafted classic, wooden toys are designed to bring out that slowness in your home. From Planes,
                trains,
                automobiles and boats, playsets, all of our wooden toys are designed to spark imagination. The going may
                be a
                little slower, but oh the things you’ll see along the way!
                Since 2018, Little Bird Toys has delighted families looking for quality children’s toys. Our collection

                        You won’t find plastic or batteries here. Our handmade toys are carefully crafted from
                        sustainable Baltic
                        birch wood and are designed, manufactured, and tested in the U.S.A – right here in Toms River,
                        NJ. Each
                        handcrafted item is made to heirloom quality, designed to not only withstand the wear of
                        childhood, but to
                        be strong enough to pass on from sibling to sibling and generation to generation. Hold one of
                        our wooden
                        toys in your hand, You’ll feel the difference that our makers bring to each handcrafted piece.
                        All of our products meet or exceed Consumer Product Safety standards and are finished with
                        toxin-free paints
                        that meet CA-prop65. Our toys undergo physical, mechanical, and fire-safety testing guided by
                        ASTM
                        standards. And every piece we craft sustains our own in-house physical testing procedure to
                        ensure unmatched
                        durability and stability.

                        Wood is an important part of who we are. Early on we chose wood for its inherently durable
                        qualities with
                        the intention of making toys and furniture that could withstand the test of time – and stay out
                        of the
                        landfill.
                        Our wooden toys are designed to withstand the wear of play and to be safely enjoyed from
                        generation to
                        generation.
                        Our process of sourcing, manufacturing, and shipping only within the U.S. allows us to support
                        our national
                        economy and reduce the often-hefty carbon emissions that come with international trade and
                        shipping.
